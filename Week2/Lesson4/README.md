### Security Audit Report

1. **npm audit**: Run `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.
2. **OWASP ZAP**: Use OWASP ZAP to perform an automated security scan against your application to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Documentation on Implemented Security Measures

1. **JWT for Authentication**: Securely handles user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
2. **Helmet**: Sets various HTTP headers to secure the app from common vulnerabilities.
3. **XSS-Clean**: Sanitizes user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
4. **HPP**: Protects against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks.
5. **CORS**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with security in mind.
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make to the API within a set time frame.
7. **HTTPS**: Uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting it from interception.
8. **Environment Variables**: Stores sensitive information like JWT secrets in environment variables, not in the codebase.
9. **Input Validation**: Validates user inputs to ensure they meet the expected format and type, reducing the risk of SQL injection and other attacks. (Note: For brevity, explicit input validation examples are not included in the script but should be implemented in a real application.)

This setup provides a solid foundation for a secure Node.js application, incorporating both authentication and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
